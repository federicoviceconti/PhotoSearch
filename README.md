# PhotoSearch

An android app, which is connecting to unsplash services to retrieve photos.

## A bit of info for who's reading

This is a photo search project. This app allow to search newest or popular photos uploaded on Unsplash.
I attached mockups of the final app on **/mockup** folder.

### How to run

Unsplash service need access token. Once you get it on unplash site, go to "UnsplashService.kt" and replace the content of ACCESS_KEY variable.

Have a good day!
